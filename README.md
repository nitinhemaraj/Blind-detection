# Blind-detection
The project initiative aimed at developing a system for detecting and recognizing objects and obstacles in the environment to assist individuals with visual impairments. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to create a real-time feedback system that provides audio or tactile alerts to the user.

## Features

### Object Detection
Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection models (e.g., YOLO, SSD) to identify common objects and obstacles in the user's vicinity.
### Real-time Feedback
Provides real-time auditory or tactile feedback to the user, conveying the type and location of detected objects.
### Customizable Alerts
Users can customize the alert preferences, such as the volume and frequency of auditory alerts or the intensity of tactile feedback.
### Accessibility
Designed with a focus on accessibility, making it compatible with various hardware setups and wearable devices.
